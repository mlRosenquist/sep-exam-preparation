		* Physical: Package diagram of physical deployment
		* Use Case
		* Process: Illustrate concurrency Process view

	* High level patterns to define structure and behaviour of system
	* Standard solution to architectural problems
	* Use the experience of others in templates. 
	* Layer, N-tier, Pipe-and-filter, repository, client-server, MVC, MVVM. 
	* Måske gå igennem attributter for bestemte
