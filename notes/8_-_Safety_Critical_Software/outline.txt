Terminology:
* Safety Critical System
	* Failures leads to loss of (Life, Health, Well Being)
	* Safety is assured
* Safety 
	* Property ensures endangerment 
	* No Accidents or losses
	* Ensure safe operation
* Security:
	* System shall not be compromised
* **Failsafe Sysatem:**
	* **Fail in a safe state**
* **Fault**
	* **Cause of an error**
* **Failure: **
	* **Failing to perform intended function**
* Useful lifetime
	* Early Failures
	* Random Failures
	* Wearout Failures
* Accident:
	* Critical events that leads to disaster
* Incident
	* Less critical than accidents. Can  be come accident. 
* Reliability 
	* System does its intended function
* Hazard
	* Situation where there is the danger of accident occuring
* Risk 
	* Combining chance of hazardous event and its severity
* Risk Management
	* Reducing risks to tolerable risk or lower. 



GENERAL OVERVIEW OF  TERMS

HOW TO MANAGE SAFETY
* Quality management should be a process included in project
* Here safety should be included
* Safety plan
	* Responsibles
	* Hazard and risk analysis
SOFTWARE IN SAFETY CRITICAL SYSTEMS
* Causes (side effect, controlfow, expression evaluation)
* Standards
* Restric constructs of programming languages
* Static Analysis tools 
	* Without opepration
		* Formal Verification
		* Control flow analysis
		* Reviews
		* Metrics
* Dynamic Analysis (Testing)
	* Black Box / White Box
	* Random
	* Coverage
* Equivalence partioniing
* Boundary Value Analysis
* Performance / Stress Test
* Simulation
Therac-25 example:
* Specification and documentation
* Quality Assurance
* Assembly
* Testing and formal analysis
* Usability
