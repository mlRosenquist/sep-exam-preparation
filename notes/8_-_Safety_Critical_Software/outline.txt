	* Hardware vs. Software
* Untested before assembly
* Failsafe 
* Overfow

**Software in Safety Critical Systems**
* + complex and flexibility
* - errors
* - testing hard
* Standards
* Software Quality Management

**What can go wrong in software**
* external side-effect
* Alias
* Control Flow
* Expression evaluation

**Software Languages**
