Context
* Completed requirements and architecture. 
* Requirements are verified (good) and validated (the right ones)
* Now we want to develop some functionality

Verification (bottom of v-model)
* Building the product right
* White box
* Unit (Drivers, Stubs)
* Integration (top, bottom, incremental)
* Equivalence Partioning & Boundary Values Analysis

Validation (Top of v-model)
* Building the right product 
* Black Box
* System 
* Acceptance 
* Regression

VDM & Formal Methods
* Model Checking
* Testing models 
* Prove correctness
* Simulation
